## About Layout Module

- The Layout Builder module allows you to customize the design of the entity such as content types, vocabularies, etc… by offering a new drag-and-drop interface. The new interface uses your front-end theme and it offers a proper preview of the actual content which will be used.
- This makes it easier to build your layouts because you won’t have to save and then see what it looks like on the front-end, you can preview your changes while building it.
- The module replaces the “Manage display” page with the new layout builder once enabled. Instead of seeing all the fields on the page, you’ll see a “Manage layout” button which redirects you to the layout builder page.
